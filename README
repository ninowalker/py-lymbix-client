= Lymbix

Lymbix is an easy to use wrapper for the Lymbix Tone API service to tonalize a phrase or passage.

To install the python Lymbix client from pypi:

  easy_install lymbix
  
To install from source:

  python setup.py install

These will create a command "lymbix-test-cli" on your path, invokable as follows:

  lymbix-test-cli __your_api_key_here__ "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."

The client will look for LYMBIX_API_KEY in your environment:

  export LYMBIX_API_KEY=...
  lymbix-test-cli "I like milk."

From code: it is possible to tonalize a phrase like:

  import lymbix
  client = lymbix.Client(__your_api_key_here__)
  client.tonalize("I prefer python. Whitespace makes me happy.")
